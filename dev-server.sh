# Stux.Digital Soonpage - Local dev server
# Usage: ./dev-server.sh [port] [--no-dev-mode]
#   port            default: 8000
#   --no-dev-mode   render exactly as production does (no dev banner)
#
# Static site, nothing to build: this serves the folder the way GitHub Pages does
# (/changelog -> changelog.html, the 404 page for missing paths) through
# .github/dev-router.php. DEV_MODE is on by default, which makes the router answer
# /assets/dev-mode.js with `window.SITE_DEV_MODE = true`, so every page shows the dev banner;
# production serves the committed assets/dev-mode.js, which leaves it off.
#
# PHP is only the local web server here. Like the other Stux projects it runs on PHP 7.4:
# $PHP_BIN if set, else php74 / php7.4 on PATH, else %LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PHP\7.4\php.exe,
# else plain php (with a warning).
